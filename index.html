        <p>While depended on number of people, a household is considered below the poverty level when its income meets a series of Federal Poverty Guidelines. In Wisconsin, just over 10% of the total population is considered to be living in poverty. Milwaukee County in particular has a higher rate than the rest of the state, even after correcting for the higher population.</p>
        <p>Poverty can be caused by unstable job markets, low wages, high rent rates, and historical barriers and discrimination. It can affect access to college, food security, healthcare, and housing. Crisises like the current coronavirus pandemic exacerbates these issues and further illustrates income inequality in the United States.</p>
        <p><i><small>Data was sourced from American Factfinder, run by the US Census, which will be closing soon in favor of a better platform. Information on poverty levels was obtained through the Institute for Research on Poverty from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</small></i></p>
